In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, salt, butter and water. Mix the ingredients with the hook to obtain a non-homogeneous dough: the butter cubes should not be completely incorporated, they remain visible in the dough. Put the dough on a floured work surface. Put the dough on a floured worktop. Form a ball with your hands. Flour the ball. With a rolling pin, roll out the ball to form a long strip 1 cm thick. Fold this strip on itself in three. Rotate the dough a quarter turn on itself and spread it again, as before. Put the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes. Repeat these operations twice more, without forgetting to put the dough in the fridge between each spreading. Each time you fold the dough, you “give the dough a turn”: for each given turn, make a mark on the dough to remind you where you stand. Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat. Peel the apples, cut them in half, remove the heart and seeds. Place the apple halves in the mould by tightening them well so that the bottom is completely covered, without leaving any free space. Sprinkle the apples with the lemon juice. Spread over the apples sugar with the finely grated tonka bean, as evenly as possible. Place the mould on a very low heat. During baking, turn the mould regularly so that the apples caramelise perfectly and evenly. This process takes about 50 minutes to 1 hour. Then remove the mould from the heat. Preheat the oven to 200 °C (th. 6-7). Meanwhile, spread the puff pastry and form a circle corresponding to the size of the mold. Remove from heat, cover the apples with puff pastry, put in the oven and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. At the end of cooking, the pastry should be light blond, but no more. Stop cooking by soaking the bottom of the mould in a basin of cold water (without wetting the dough). Leave the caramel to cool for 30 minutes. To unmould the Tatin tart easily, warm the bottom of the tin over a fairly high heat for a few moments to soften the caramel. Turn the tart over onto a serving dish and serve.",

          "recipe_name": "ROAST BEEF WITH CARAMELISED ONION GRAVY",
          "ingredients": "1 head of garlic (about 12 cloves), cut in half, 5 thyme sprigs, leaves picked, plus 1 extra, 1.8kg beef sirloin, 3 to 4 tbsp olive oil, 4 large onions, sliced, 150g plain flour, 500ml red wine, 1.5 litres hot beef stock",
          "cooking_method": "Rub the garlic halves and thyme leaves all over the beef. Place the joint in a large dish, drizzle over the olive oil, then rub it into the meat all over. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1–2 days before you cook it (you don’t have to marinate the beef in advance, but it does make it super tasty! – see Tip). Take the beef out of the fridge about an hour before cooking, to let it come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/Gas 5. Preheat a dry frying pan until very hot, then sear the beef over a high heat until it’s coloured on all sides. Place the beef in a large, hob-proof roasting tray with the garlic halves and the thyme sprig and roast for about 45 minutes for medium rare (or until it reaches 45–47°C in the centre, if you have a meat thermometer). Add 10–12 minutes for medium (or until it reaches 55–60°C in the centre), or add about 20 minutes if you like it well done (or until it reaches 65–70°C in the centre). Transfer the beef to a warm platter, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for at least 20 minutes, and anything up to 40 minutes, before serving. Meanwhile, to make the gravy, place the roasting tray over a low heat on the hob, add the onions to the juices in the tray and cook gently for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until really soft and caramelised. Stir in the flour until combined, then whisk in the red wine, making sure there are no lumps. Bring to the boil, whisking, then bubble rapidly until the red wine has reduced by half. Stir in the hot stock, then cook over a medium heat for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until reduced to a thick gravy. Carve the beef thinly and pour the gravy into a warm jug. Serve with Yorkshire Puddings and steamed chard.",

          "recipe_name": "HOLIDAY LEMON-HERB CHICKEN THIGHS WITH A CRISPY BACON GRAVY",
          "ingredients": "8 each bone-in chicken thighs (about 3-4 pounds), Flaky sea salt and fresh cracked pepper, to taste, Olive oil, as needed, 2-3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, Pinch of chili flakes, to taste, 1 lemon, zested",
          "cooking_method": "Preheat oven to 425˚F. Prepare chicken thighs, seasoning skin-side generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large fry pan over medium-high heat, drizzle with olive oil and sear thighs, skin side down until caramelized, about 3-5 minutes. Dust chicken thighs with flour and generously season with salt, pepper, chili flakes and lemon zest. Flip thighs over and “fry” flour into rendered chicken fat for 2-3 minutes, remove chicken thighs and set aside while preparing gravy. For the gravy - Add bacon to pan, cooking until crisp and scraping up caramelized bits. Add onions and garlic to the pan, cooking until just tender and fragrant, about a minute. Slice 1 lemon into wedges and scatter around the pan along with fresh herbs, cook for another minute. Deglaze with cider and simmer until reduced by half. Stir in hot chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Return chicken thighs to the pan, skin side up, nestling into the gravy. Zest remaining lemon over chicken and season with salt, pepper, and chili flakes. Pop into the oven to roast until crispy, about 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Serve straight out of the pan, garnishing with sliced lemon and fresh herbs.  ",

          "recipe_name": "STUFFED LAMB WITH SPINACH AND PINE NUTS",
          "ingredients": "1 small onion, peeled and chopped, 2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced, Olive oil, for frying, 3 tbsp pine nuts, 250g young spinach, washed, 150g feta cheese, crumbled, 1 boned saddle of lamb, about 1.75-2kg (ask your butcher to bone it for you) 1-2 tsp sumac, to taste, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
          "cooking_method": "Sauté the onion and garlic in a medium-hot pan with a dash of olive oil for 5 minutes until softened. Season, then add the pine nuts and fry for about 1 minute until golden. Add the spinach and wilt briefly in the pan, tossing to mix well. Remove from the heat and stir in the feta. Lay the saddle of lamb open on a board, flesh side up. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle over the sumac. Spoon the spinach mixture along the middle of the meat, using the fillets that run down the inside length of the meat to support the sides of the stuffing. Roll the meat around the filling and tie at intervals with string. Season the outside of the lamb all over, then chill for at least 30 minutes or overnight to help firm it up and make it easier to brown. Preheat the oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Put a roasting tray on the hob and heat until hot. Add a glug of oil and fry the joint for 10 minutes until brown all over. Transfer to the preheated oven and cook for 45-55 minutes, depending on the weight of the lamb and how pink you like it. When cooked, set aside to rest. Meanwhile, mix all the dressing ingredients together and add a little seasoning.",
